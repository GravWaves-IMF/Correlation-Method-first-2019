## Introduction ##

In the following, we use the Pearson cross-correlation statistic proposed by [Liu and Jackson](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2016/10/014/meta),
and employed by [Creswell et al.](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2017/08/013/meta), [Nielsen et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04071) to look for statistically significant correlations between
the LIGO Hanford and Livingston detectors at the time of the binary black hole mergers detected during O1.
Furthermore, the same analysis will be done for event GW170104, as problems concerning the residual correlation of the detectors were raised also for that particular event of O2 [Creswell et al.](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2017/08/013/meta).
The analysis will follow the same pipelines used in [GW150914_investigation](https://github.com/gwastro/gw150914_investigation), in particular, we will generate the residuals.hdf file for each event by subtracting the Maximum-Likelihood Waveforms generated by [Biwer et al.](https://github.com/gwastro/pycbc-inference-paper), while the raw strain data of the detectors at the time of the events will be obtained by [GWOSC](https://www.gw-openscience.org/catalog/GWTC-1-confident/).
